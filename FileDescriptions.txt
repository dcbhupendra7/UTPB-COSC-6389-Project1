File Descriptions for Project

1. Knapsack.py
- Solves the Knapsack Problem using a genetic algorithm.
- Uses tournament selection for better solution diversity.
- Implements uniform crossover and multi-point mutation.
- Stops when a good solution is found or after a set number of generations.

2. TravellingSalesman.py
   - This file implements the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
   - The solution uses simulated annealing to progressively improve the solution by exploring new routes.

3. SubsetSumProblem.py
   - This file solves the Subset Sum Problem, which involves finding a subset of a given set of integers that adds up to a specified target value.
   - Two solvers are implemented: a backtracking solver that exhaustively searches all possible subsets, and a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver that finds an approximate solution efficiently.

4. ParticleSwarmsSubset.py
   - This file focuses on solving the Subset Sum Problem using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) specifically.
   - PSO is a heuristic approach that is inspired by the collective behavior of birds flocking or fish schooling, and is used to find a solution by iteratively improving candidate solutions.
